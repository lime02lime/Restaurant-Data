# Restaurant-Data

Hello!

In this kaggle notebook I analyze some data relating to restaurants in Bangalore. It is quite a large dataset with more than 40,000 restaurants. Each one has a quite a few datapoints, including ratings, number of votes, location, cuisine, etc. The kaggle notebook with the linked data is available through this link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/emilengdahl/restaurant-ratings-analysis

In this notebook l look at the dataset to see what are the main factors influencing a restaurant's score. There may be a positive correlation between variables, but a strong negative correlation is also greatly informative.

As our dataset is large, we have many tools available to us. We walk through a few of them in this notebook.
